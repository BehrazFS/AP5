# Country-Conquest-Game-Advanced-Programming-Project-5

This project is a strategic, real-time **country conquest game**, inspired by *State.io - Conquer the World*. The game is implemented in Java and supports  **offline multiplayer** gameplay using random world maps.

The main goal is to **conquer all enemy territories** and become the last remaining state. Players start with one country and expand by strategically sending units to neighboring territories.

### ⚔️ Conquest Rules

* Each player starts with **one country** and equal power across all countries.
* To capture a target country, the attacker must send units **greater than** the target's defense.
* If successful, the excess units are added to the newly captured country.
* Not all countries are capturable from the start — some may require strategic buildup.
* Enemy players are eliminated once all their countries are captured.
